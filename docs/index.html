                <h2>Why music industry ?</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Music has thoroughly evolved in the past decades and so did its industry. Genres appeared as well as
                    new numerous labels that changed the music landscape. New technologies also changed the way music is
                    consumed, both in the music support (numeric, MP3 …) and in the way it can be shared and discovered.
                    <br>
                    To grasp at the importance of the music industry, let us say that last year, it was worth <b>20
                    billion $ only in the U.S</b>. Although online platforms such as Spotify are on the rise, records
                        more popular
                        each year, with a <b>+14% increase in 2018 for vinyls in the U.S</b>. Discogs is the number 1
                        online worldwide records selling platform.

                <h2>Why Discogs ?</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    We chose to use Discogs as our Dataset for the project.
                    Discogs.com is an online records marketplace. It acts as a place for music collectors to buy/sell
                    records, as well as track the evolution of the prices of releases they consider acquiring. Discogs
                    is a social network as well, and users can connect to each other and share the list of their
                    favorite records.
                    <br>
                    A useful feature of Discogs is its API along with a Python plugin that allows to easily browse and
                    gather information about records, artists and labels from the database. Our aim is to download the
                    latest data files (*XML* format) to create the skeleton of our dataset and then enrich it using the
                    API or web-scraping to gather more relevant informations.

                <h4 class="">Speaking of time and evolution, let’s have a glance at the number of
                    casualties from
                    2014 to 2016:</h4>
                <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto"><img src="./img/casualties_history.png"

                <p class="lead mt-3">As expected, the number of casualties has decreased linearly over the years except
                    for a bump in 2014. What is even more interesting is when we compare this evolution, to the
                    evolution of the <b>traffic itself which increased by more than 5%</b> over the same period. It
                    shows that this significant decrease over time is not due to lower traffic but to policies and
                    technical upgrades made to the vehicles! <b>Road safety policies are working!</b>
                </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
                <p class="lead">One last thing to look at from a global viewpoint is the repartition of casualties from
                    2004 to 2016:</p>
                <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto"><img src="./img/casualties_classes.png" width="100%"
                                                    alt="Evolution of the number of casualties over the years"></div>
                <p class="lead">The first observation is that passengers make for around 25% of the accident casualties,
                    with a majority of them being car passengers rather than coach ones. Moreover, <b>pedestrians
                        represent more than 10% of the casualties</b>, which is a very significant part as they can only
                    be impacted in specific circumstances in urban areas: they are almost always the victims rather than
                    the person causing the accident. Finally, casualties still mainly concern drivers and riders: people
                    who are allegedly responsible for taking every possible steps in order to avoid accidents. It could be
                    explained in two ways: the high proportion of people taking their car alone, to commute for instance,
                    and the increasing part of bike riders having road accidents.
                    <br>
                    Despite this context, the government has still taken no action to make wearing helmets compulsory
                    for bike users.

                <p class="lead">Who has never been stuck in traffic? One could imagine that a reduced pace rhymes with
                    less accidents? Or on the opposite, more cars on the road entails more accidents? We used our data
                    to demonstrate the second proposition. While the trend looks alike for week days there is a huge
                    difference with week-ends.</p>

                <p class="lead mt-3">Rush hours are blatant at 8am and around 5pm, plus it is interesting to notice that
                    the peak lasts longer in the afternoon: are people tired and thus less alert ? While on week-ends,
                    people seem to be moving around lunch and tea time (do not forget we are talking about UK!).
                    <br>
                    In order to understand whether accidents related to commuting are due to traffic jams or just to the
                    increase of drivers on the road, we compared rush hour in urban and rural areas during week days and
                    week-ends.

                <p class="lead">As one can see, rush hours are still seeable in rural areas even though they are less
                    pronounced than for urban areas. What is interesting is that the difference between rural and urban
                    areas decrease on Sunday: are people going to the countryside on Sunday ?
                    <br><br>
                    On the whole, reducing the number of vehicles involved in rush hours could led to a significant
                    decrease of the number of accidents: commuting at odd hours (10am - 8pm for instance) is safer than
                    commuting “like everyone else”.

                    the number of casualties and these features was far above its correlation with the light conditions
                    or the weather which are almost negligible unlike what people usually think! That’s quite
                    surprising, thus we decided to dig deeper to understand and maybe explain this cliché.

                <p class="lead">
                    The common knowledge says that driving when the weather is poor is more dangerous.
                    Therefore, we tried to spot a difference in the number of accidents when the weather is poor
                    or not.
                    The problem is we do not know how often the weather is bad and therefore we do not have any proper
                    normalization.
                    For that reason we plotted the average number of casualties per accident given many different weather
                    condition:
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="lead">
                    But that plot showed that there isn’t much difference between different weather conditions.
                    The second step was to find the most dangerous locations in the UK and to compute the
                    frequencies of accidents when the weather is bad at these dangerous locations:

                <p class="lead">
                    The plot show that there is mostly no difference across these different locations, telling us that
                    they are
                    not
                    more dangerous when the weather is bad. However there is a clear outlier that merits further work.
                    It corresponds to the location (51.498, -0.497) which we checked on Google Maps:
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    And the funny thing is that we discovered that this location was indeed particularly dangerous and
                    that
                    during bad weather it could be particularly difficult for a car on the right lane to be able to
                    enter
                    the road… So, act up UK!

                <p class="lead">
                    Every driver has to be covered by a car insurance of which fares are a very sensitive topics,
                    depending on age, experience and even gender. Bonuses are supposed to depend on established facts
                    enabling the computation of the likelihood of having a car accident. For instance, some insurances
                    offer bonuses for female driver: to what extent can our data support this advantage?
                    <br>
                    From 2005 to 2015, data shows that female drivers almost have half as much car accident than male
                    drivers, justifying a bonuses for car insurance companies. Yet, we can not conclude that it is safer
                    to drive for women, because the difference in the number of accident could be explained by a
                    difference in the number of driver: yet, are men driving twice as much as women?

                    Is there any other features which could be taken into account to propose bonuses to client? We
                    investigated the other features provided in the dataset and came to the following conclusions:
                </p>
                <ul class="lead">
                    <li>The well-known maluses for young drivers, for instance drivers under 25 in the United States, is
                        not
                        justified by our dataset: young drivers even belong to one of the less accident-prone
                        categories.
                        However insurance companies own data about the proportion of young adult driving and can,
                        therefore,
                        draw a more relevant conclusion. We lack data to properly normalize our
                        dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>The same approach can be used for elderly which are even less accident-prone than young
                        drivers.
                    </li>
                    <li>The peak between 26 and 45 years old could be explained by intense working activity inducing a
                        fair
                        amount
                        and commuting, hence more risks of ending in a car accident.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Similarly, there is a burst in the number of accident for urban-originated driver which could
                        be
                        taken into account by insurances: depending on where you learn to drive and where you
                        predominantly

                    In a nutshell, this data is <b>highly valuable for insurance companies</b> because it helps
                    computing the likelihood of car accident for a driver depending on several characteristics. Combined
                    with the frequency of insured drivers it can build <b>a relevant overview of at-risk-drivers</b>.
                    One also has to notice that combining such data can be quite <b>intrusive</b> for insured persons
                    and goes against the concept of sympathy behind insurance.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    The goal of this study was to aggregate and understand data on road accidents in the leading country
                    for road safety in Europe: the United Kingdom. By feeding our datasets into the Big Data blackbox,
                    we gained insights and highlighted trends with some surprises.
                    <br>
                    Choosing among the endless leads provided by the data has been a challenge. Yet, the biggest
                    challenge encountered has been the lack of information on traffic itself which forced us into
                    thinking
                    differently and come up with innovative baselines.
                    <br>
                    Finally, studying road accidents has been a very interesting and challenging topic illustrating how
                    data science has a highly positive and concrete impact on policies and government decisions.
