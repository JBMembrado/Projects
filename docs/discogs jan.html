                <h2>Why the music industry ?</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Music has thoroughly evolved in the past decades and so did its industry. Genres appeared as well as
                    new numerous labels that changed the music landscape. New technologies also changed the way music is
                    consumed, both in the music support (numeric, MP3 â€¦) and in the way it can be shared and discovered.
                    <br>
                    To grasp at the importance of the music industry, let us say that last year, it was worth <b>20
                    billion $ only in the U.S</b>. Although online platforms such as Spotify are on the rise, records
                        more popular
                        each year, with a <b>+14% increase in 2018 for vinyls in the U.S</b>. Discogs is the number 1
                        online worldwide records selling platform.

                <h2>Why Discogs ?</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    We chose to use Discogs as our Dataset for the project.
                    Discogs.com is an online records marketplace. It acts as a place for music collectors to buy/sell
                    records, as well as track the evolution of the prices of releases they consider acquiring. Discogs
                    is a social network as well, and users can connect to each other and share the list of their
                    favorite records.
                    <br>
                    A useful feature of Discogs is its API along with a Python plugin that allows to easily browse and
                    gather information about records, artists and labels from the database. Our aim is to download the
                    latest data files (<i>XML</i> format) to create the skeleton of our dataset and then enrich it using
                    the
                    API or web-scraping to gather more relevant informations.

                <h2>A global look at the evolution of the music industry</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">A simple exploration of our dataset gives us the number of Master releases each
                year. Each record in the Discogs database is represented by a unique <b>Master</b>, but can
                    actually be attached to several <b>Release</b> entities. Each Release for a record is a
                    commercially  distributed copy of the record. It corresponds to a year of release, a country in
                    which it has been released, a physical support and a label. If we take for instance, the
                    fan-favorite classic <i>Led Zeppelin
                        I</i> record : it is associated to one Master entity, but 603 different Releases in vinyl,
                    compact disc or cassette over several labels and reissues.

            <div class="col-lg-10 mt-4 mx-auto">
                <p class="lead">The number of Master released per year is linearly increasing starting in the 1950s.
                    This evolution is indeed the actual evolution of the number of records that were released each
                    year. The music industry is in good shape as we see that the increase of record production isn't
                    about to stop !
                    <br>
                    The number of Releases per Master is also increasing in the 1960s, with a downward trend during the
                    1990s. The average number of Releases per Master is obtained by counting the number of Releases
                    for each Master each year, and dividing by the total number of Masters in this year. This
                    evolution show a bump starting in the 1960s until the beginning of the 1980s. Two factors explain
                    this :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Here each Release is attached to its Master, and that is the year of the Master that
                            prevails. This means that for our beloved <i>Led Zeppelin I</i> (this record is crazy
                            good, I love it, go listen to it if you haven't already), all the 603 associated Releases
                            count for the year 1968, that is the year of the first release. This means that older
                            records are more likely to have more Releases associated than recent ones : they are
                            more likely to have been reprinted since it was initially released.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another factor explains the downfall during the 1980s : in 1982, <i>Philips</i> in a
                            collective effort with Sony, launched the first Compact Disc. It quickly became the
                            physical support of choice, replacing progressively the vinyl. Between the launch of the
                            Compact Disc, and the death of the vinyl format at the beginning of the 1990s, every
                            record was released both in CD and vinyl, effectively raising the number of Releases for
                            each record.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    TODO
                    From the 50s, the post-World War II economic expansion had a huge impact on consumerism,
                    especially in the U.S. Goods and services were created deliberately for young people as spending
                    power skyrocketted. The access of music through the democratisation of vinyl created a huge
                    expansion of the newborn music industry. We can hypothesize that the dip in the 70s comes
                    respectively from the oil crash in 1973 and the energy crisis in 1979. These events led to a period
                    of recession, affecting all the markets, including the music one. One could argue that the second
                    dip in the 2000s was caused by the internet as music piracy exploded (the famous peer-to-peer
                    website Nasper was launched in 1999) leading to a decline in CD sales, thus again affecting the
                    industry. Surely, the financial crash of 2008 did not help. The huge peak in the recent years
                    could be the development of many streaming platforms - as increasing internet data rates allowed
                    continous streaming of media - democratizing even more various artists.
                    <br>
                    Notwithstanding this last point, we can distinguish a certain form of exhausation (i.e. if we
                    compare this market with the demographic expansion) maybe caused by a saturation of various artists
                    led by the streaming revolution.

                <p class="lead mt-3">To corroborate what we just said above, let's have a look at the evolution of
                    records formats from the 1950s. As expected, the vinyl had a golden age until the beginning of
                    the 1990s, its death mainly caused by the arrival of the CD. But WOW, we just said that the CD
                    appeared in 1982, and we see that we have data for CD records even in the 1950s. Impressive.
                    Let's stop joking : the CD Releases are attached to their Master. That is, if a record released
                    in 1968, for instance <i>Led Zeppelin I</i> was to be released in CD during the 1980s, it would
                    still appear as a released in 1968 in the database, as it is the year its corresponding Master
                    was released.
